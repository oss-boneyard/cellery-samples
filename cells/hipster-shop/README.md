# Cell-Based Hipster Shop Application

All details of the original application, "Hipster Shop: Cloud-Native Microservices Demo Application" can be found [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo). 

The Hipster Shop project contains a 10-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app called **“Hipster Shop”** where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

## Service Architecture

**Hipster Shop** is composed of many microservices written in different languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

microservices](../../docs/images/hipster-shop/architecture-diagram.png)](../../docs/images/hipster-shop/architecture-diagram.png)

## Cell Architecture

**Hipster Shop** is composed of many microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC. This sample is structured into 5 cells: 
- [ads](ads)
- [products](products)
- [cart](cart)
- [checkout](checkout)
- [front-end](front-end)

[![Cell architecture of
Hipster Shop services](../../docs/images/hipster-shop/hipstershop-cell-architecture.png)](../../docs/images/hipster-shop/hipstershop-cell-architecture.png)

## Quick Deploy the Hipster Shop Cells
Execute the command below to deploy the pre-built cell images in one go. If you are interested in building and running the cell images, execute the steps explained [here](#build-and-deploy-the-hipstershop-cells).

**Note:** If you are testing this sample with GCP setup, you may need to [add additional node pool](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-pools) to the cluster in order to provide the required resources.

```
cellery run wso2cellery/front-end-cell:0.6.0 -n front-end-cell -l cartCellDep:cart-cell -l productsCellDep:products-cell -l adsCellDep:ads-cell -l checkoutCellDep:checkout-cell -d

```

Run cellery view command to see the components of your cell. This will open a HTML page in a browser and you can visualize the components and the dependent cells of the cell.

```
$ cellery view wso2cellery/ads-cell:0.6.0

### 8. View the application
You would have already added the `/etc/host` entries during the cellery installation as mentioned in [local](https://github.com/wso2/cellery/blob/v0.6.0/docs/setup/local-setup.md#configure-host-entries), 
[GCP](https://github.com/wso2/cellery/blob/v0.6.0/docs/setup/gcp-setup.md#configure-host-entries) and
[existing kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/wso2/cellery/blob/v0.6.0/docs/setup/existing-cluster.md#configure-host-entries). 
You will also need to add the entry `my-hipstershop.com` to the `/etc/host` file as shown below.

```
192.168.56.10 wso2-apim cellery-dashboard wso2sp-observability-api wso2-apim-gateway cellery-k8s-metrics idp.cellery-system pet-store.com hello-world.com my-hello-world.com my-hipstershop.com
```

Access url [http://my-hipstershop.com/](http://my-hipstershop.com/) from a browser and you can now try out the Hipster Shop application.

## Observability
The hipster shop cells and components can be observed in runtime, and it provides overview about the cells, components, metrics, and distributed tracing. Below are 
some of the screenshots of observability provided by [http://cellery-dashboard](http://cellery-dashboard). You can find more information about the observability 
[here](https://github.com/wso2/cellery/blob/v0.6.0/docs/cellery-observability.md).
